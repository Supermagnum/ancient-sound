# ancient-sound
This is a collection of samples of ancient European instruments.  The instrument notes has been separated as one file per note, in their respective folder. Those notes are also the specific instruments tonal range, in some instances it is possible to play half notes if half of the finger hole is covered.

The instruments are:

A cow-horn that is blown like a trumpet, it has holes in it so it can be played like a flute. It's quite ancient and was used up to the 1500's. Just one sample as I am a HORRIBLE player, it has a lot more tonal range.

A flute made of sheep bone.

A iron age lyre.

A bronze age lure ( included because that these was also used during the iron age).

A Buzzing bone ( bone with hole threaded on an string, rotated with bow or similar ).

A iron age flute.

A staff with rings on, these rattles when the wooden staff is struck in to the ground (rattlestaff).

Time range for the instruments must be 300th to 1300th century.

How to contribute:
Record the instruments entire tonal range, starting from the lowest note to the top note.
Split the recording in to one sound file per note,
the format of the name should be xx-name-of-instrument. 
Lossless audio format is preferred.

The files should be put in a folder named with the instruments name,this must be put in the instruments folder.
Also,include the original sound file,that goes into the raw-files folder.

If the instrument is a percussion instrument, put it in the rythmic folder.
